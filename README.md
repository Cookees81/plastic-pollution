##  Project 3
* Project Name: Plastic Pollution
* Environmental Impact: Teresa Salazar
* Team Members: Judd Sanders, Michael Jardinico, Kimberly Toro, Teresa Salazar, Scott Chen 
* Date submitted: Jan 8, 2024

### Project Overview
`The primary objective of this analysis is aimed to thoroughly assess the effects of plastic pollution on the health of the global environment and ecosystems. Utilizing existing worldwide data, it reveals the stark truth that Plastic Pollution poses a considerable threat to both the global environment and health, underlining the pressing nature as an urgent global crisis. `

### Methodology
`The study utilized a comprehensive approach, incorporating a mix of quantitative and qualitative data. This included analysis of global pollution data, ecological studies, wildlife impact assessments, and socio-economic impacts of plastic waste. Furthermore, expert opinions, historical data trends, and future projections were also considered.`

### Working Files
1. plastic-pollution- Mismanaged plastic waste to ocean per capita (kg per year)
2. MarineMicroplastics_beaches.csv
3. project_3_Teresa_mismanaged_waste-checkpoint

### Instructions
1. ![sorted_high](sorted_high.png)
2. ![mismanaged_box](mismanaged_box.png)
3. ![just_beaches](just_beaches.png)

Didn't use #3 as it wasn't completed on time and dataset showed mostly Mexico data. Also, did not plot MarineMicroplastics.csv as file was so large it caused major issues when manipulating data.

Data Usage Disclaimer: Microplastics vary in origin, density, chemical properties, morphology, size and color. At present, there is no single combination of methods for sampling, extracting, analyzing, and reporting. Thus, the microplastic concentrations in the database may not always be comparable across studies. Users should consider the metadata in the archives which contain more details about the data records (such as sampling protocols and instrumental analysis) for further usability of the data.
